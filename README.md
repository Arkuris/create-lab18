# create-lab18
## Where I am At now:
- So I made all my repo's for Create Read Update and Delete, I made them all into zip files and uploaded them into their own Lambda functions. I Linked all 4 lambda functions to my API Gate-way called CRUD-people-api. Idk why but I cant seem to get my Api to work :( You should be able to just type in /people or /people{id} to reach a route but yeah... I get this error. {"message":"Internal Server Error"}

## LINK TO MY DEPLOYED API:
[API Gateway URL](https://409zetmbql.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/production)
